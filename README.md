# MyWallet
Personal Finances Tracker created using ASP.NET Core and C#

## Application Logic
The application is a personal finances tracker. The user will be able to register accounts, which in the system works as cost centers, and categories, divided into expenses and incomes.

After accessing the system, the user will be directed to the login screen. If he tried to access directly any other page of page of the application without being logged, the system will automatically redirect the connection to the login screen.  
If the user doesn't have an account, he can create one filling the registration form.  
The form has a validation configuration to ensure the user has filled all fields with proper information.  
After being logged, the user needs to register one or more accounts and categories. Then, he will be able to record the expenses and keep track of his financial situation.
